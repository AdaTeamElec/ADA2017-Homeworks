# 50 Years of Terrorism

# Abstract

Terrorism is a subject largely covered in the media, and, unfortunately, we became accustomed to its presence worldwide, particularly over the last decade. Nevertheless, the problem we are facing today is not new. The source of certain conflicts dates from multiple decades, some of which are still lasting today. Our goal is to track and vizualize terrorism evolution through the past 50 years based on "[The Global Terrorism Database](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd)". There are many questions we can ask ourselves about terrorism, such as "Is EU less safe nowadays ?", "Did attack mediums & reasons change over the years ?" or "Can we discriminate current/future conflictual zones ?". It would be presumptuous from us to say that we are going to solve major issues, or even predict futur attacks. However, through the exploration of the dataset, and by trying to answer those interrogations, we aim to grasp an overview and a better understanding to the evolution of terrorism.


# Research questions

### Data Analysis & Vizualization

- Have terrorist attack become more frequent over the years ?
- Did the number of casualties increased country-wise/worldwide, over the years ?
- Where and when did the deadliest attacks occur ?
- What is the evolution of attack's mediums & reasons ? Who is targeted ?
- Is the religious factor always responsible for terrorist attacks ? (enough data ?)

### Main Questions
- Is it possible to create an accurate predicting model of terrorist attacks ?
- Would it be possible to create graphes and predict the evolution of attack intensity for next years ?
- Are political context of a country and recurrence of terrorist attack linked somehow ? 
- Did dangerous areas changed over the years. Is EU less safe nowadays ? 
- Are the threats in specific countries the same as in the past ?


# Dataset
The dataset is composed of a list of terrorist attacks that occurred since 1970. It is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland. It contains a numerous amount of features for each event such as localization (latitude, longitude, country), attack type, summary, number of death, number of wounded, target type, motive, claiming entity, ransom, etc..
Complete informations about the dataset on the [Global Terrorism Database](http://start.umd.edu/gtd/about/) website.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Objective is to be done with the data analysis & visualization part (answering the 5 questions above) for milestone 2.


# Questions for TAs
Fine for now :)
