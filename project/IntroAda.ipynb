    "## Abstract\n",
    "Terrorism is a subject largely covered in the media, and, unfortunately, we became accustomed to its presence worldwide, particularly over the last decade. Nevertheless, the problem we are facing today is not new. The source of certain conflicts dates from multiple decades, some of which are still lasting today. Our goal is to track and vizualize terrorism evolution through the past 50 years based on \"The Global Terrorism Database\". There are many questions we can ask ourselves about terrorism, such as \"Is EU less safe nowadays ?\", \"Did attack mediums & reasons change over the years ?\" or \"Can we discriminate current/future conflictual zones ?\". It would be presumptuous from us to say that we are going to solve major issues, or even predict futur attacks. However, through the exploration of the dataset, and by trying to answer those interrogations, we aim to grasp an overview and a better understanding to the evolution of terrorism.\n",

    "First of all, we need to take a deep look into the details of our dataset to sort out the relevant data we will be using to conduct our observations. The Global Terrorism Dataset contains 135 features and approximately 170'000 entries. In order to select the label we will keep, we used the official [documentation](http://start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf) from the dataset which describes each features precisely. Let's make a quick summary of the labels from the dataset we decided to use for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `eventid` : this is the id of any entry, written as 12 numbers (first 8 digits are the date of event and last 4 digits are a sequential case number for the given day). This will be used as our index too.\n",
    "* `iyear`, `imonth`, `iday` : Year, month and day of the event. In some rare occasion the month or days are unknown.\n",
    "* `country_txt` : id and name of the country where the event took place.\n",
    "* `region_txt` : id and region where the event took place.\n",
    "* `city` : This field contains the name of the city, village, or town in which the incident occurred. If the city, village, or town for an incident is unknown, then this field contains the smallest administrative area below provstate which can be found for the incident (e.g., district).  \n",
    "* `latitude` and `longitude` : Latitude and Longitude values where the event took place.\n",
    "* `doubtterr` : boolean value set as 1 if there is a doubt to whether the incident is an act of terrorism and 0 if there is no doubt of a terrorist attack.\n",
    "* `success` : boolean value set as 1 if the incident was successful or 0 if it was not. As stated in the documentation, \"Success of a terrorist strike is defined according to the tangible effects of the attack. Success is not judged in terms of the larger goals of the perpetrators. For example, a bomb that exploded in a building would be counted as a success even if it did not succeed in bringing the building down or inducing government repression.\" \n",
    "* `suicide` : boolean value set as 1 if the attack perpetrator did not intend to escape from the attack alive, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "* `attacktype1_txt` : This field captures the general method of attack and often reflects the broad class of tactics used. It consists of nine categories, which are defined below :\n",
    "    1. Assassination\n",
    "    2. Armed Assault\n",

    "    8. Unarmed Assault\n",

    "* `targtype1_txt` : The target/victim type field captures the general type of target/victim. When a victim is attacked specifically because of his or her relationship to a particular person, such as a prominent figure, the target type reflects that motive. For example, if a family member of a government official is attacked because of his or her relationship to that individual, the type of target is “government.” This variable consists of the following 22 categories: <br>\n",

    "    21. Utilities, facilities for generation or transmission of energy\n",
    "    22. Violent political parties\n",
    "* `gname` : This field contains the name of the group that carried out the attack. In order to ensure consistency in the usage of group names for the database, the GTD database uses a standardized list of group names that have been established by project staff to serve as a reference for all subsequent entries.  \n",
    "* `gname2` : This field is used to record the name of the second perpetrator when responsibility for the attack is attributed to more than one perpetrator. Conventions follow “Perpetrator Group” field.  \n",
    "* `gname3` : same as for gname2\n",
    "* `nperps` : This field indicates the total number of terrorists participating in the incident. (In the instance of multiple perpetrator groups participating in one case, the total number of perpetrators, across groups, is recorded). There are often discrepancies in information on this value.   \n",
    "* `weaptype1_txt` : This field records the general type of weapon used in the incident. It consists of the following categories: <br>\n",
    "    1. Biological\n",

A part from the kept features, we explored some other features such as `weaptype2`, `weapsubtype` or `motive` to see if those would bring added informations thus be relevant to use also. However, we decided to drop them because of a too large amount of NaN or unknown entries.
